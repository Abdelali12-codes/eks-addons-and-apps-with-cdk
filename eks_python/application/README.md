The **T family (burstable)** is designed for workloads that **don‚Äôt need full CPU all the time** but occasionally need a spike in CPU. Here‚Äôs why it exists and why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúburstable‚Äù:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ How T instances work**

*   They have a **baseline CPU performance** (e.g., 20‚Äì40% of one CPU core).
    
*   They accumulate **CPU credits** when underutilized.
    
*   When workload spikes, they can **burst above baseline** using these credits.
    
*   Once credits run out, CPU throttles back to baseline.
    

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Key characteristics**

*   **Low-cost**: You pay less because the baseline CPU is low.
    
*   **Good for intermittent workloads**: CPU-heavy work happens occasionally, not continuously.
    
*   **Memory**: Moderate, generally enough for small servers or dev/test applications.
    

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why T instances are useful for Airflow**

*   **Development environments** or **small test clusters**: Scheduler & Webserver often sit idle most of the time, only spiking occasionally when tasks run.
    
*   **Cost-efficient**: Perfect for dev/test where full-time CPU is not needed.
    

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ When NOT to use T instances**

*   Heavy production **workers** with continuous CPU-heavy DAGs ‚Üí will exhaust credits quickly, leading to throttling.
    
*   Memory-intensive DAGs that need more RAM than the T family provides.
    

üí° **Rule of thumb for Airflow**:

*   **T family ‚Üí dev/test Airflow**
    
*   **M/C/R ‚Üí production Airflow**


# Moderate

In the context of **EC2 instance classifications** like ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù for CPU or memory, it‚Äôs a **relative term** used by AWS to compare instance families. Let me break it down clearly:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù means**

*   **CPU:** The instance has **enough processing power for typical workloads**, but it‚Äôs **not optimized for heavy compute tasks** like the C family.
    
*   **Memory:** The RAM is **sufficient for normal applications**, but it‚Äôs **less than memory-optimized (R family)**.
    
*   **Contextual:** It sits **between Low (T family) and High (C or R family)**.
    

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Examples**

| Instance    | CPU      | Memory   | Notes                                         |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| m6i.large  | Moderate | Moderate | Balanced general-purpose; scheduler/webserver |
| c6i.large  | High     | Moderate | CPU-heavy; worker for data processing         |
| r6i.large  | Moderate | High     | Memory-heavy; worker for large in-memory jobs|
| t3.medium  | Low      | Moderate | Burstable; dev/test workloads                 |


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Takeaway**

*   **Moderate = ‚Äúenough for typical workloads but not specialized‚Äù**.
    
*   Use **moderate CPU** for tasks that don‚Äôt constantly max CPU.
    
*   Use **moderate memory** for tasks that don‚Äôt need huge RAM.
