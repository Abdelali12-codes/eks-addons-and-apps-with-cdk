**1️⃣ Compute-Optimized (C family)**
------------------------------------

**Examples:** c6i, c7g, c5, c6g

*   **Designed for:** High CPU workloads.
    
*   **Characteristics:**
    
    *   More **vCPUs per dollar** than general purpose.
        
    *   Moderate memory.
        
    *   Fast processors (often latest Intel, AMD, or Graviton).
        
*   **Best for:**
    
    *   CPU-intensive tasks like data transformations, simulations, encoding, compression.
        
    *   Airflow: **workers running CPU-heavy DAGs**.
        
*   **Not ideal for:** Memory-heavy tasks or large in-memory processing.
    

**2️⃣ Memory-Optimized (R family)**
-----------------------------------

**Examples:** r6i, r7g, r5, r6g

*   **Designed for:** High memory workloads.
    
*   **Characteristics:**
    
    *   More **RAM per vCPU** than general-purpose or compute-optimized.
        
    *   Moderate CPU, so less ideal for pure CPU tasks.
        
*   **Best for:**
    
    *   In-memory databases, caching, analytics, ETL jobs that require large memory.
        
    *   Airflow: workers running **memory-heavy DAGs**, e.g., Pandas, Spark tasks.
        
*   **Not ideal for:** Pure CPU-bound workloads.
    

**3️⃣ General Purpose (M family)**
----------------------------------

**Examples:** m6i, m7g, m5, m6g

*   **Designed for:** Balanced CPU and memory.
    
*   **Characteristics:**
    
    *   Good **all-around performance**.
        
    *   Suitable for workloads that are neither CPU-heavy nor memory-heavy.
        
*   **Best for:**
    
    *   Web servers, small databases, backend services.
        
    *   Airflow: **scheduler, webserver, small workers with moderate load**.
        
*   **Not ideal for:** Extreme CPU-heavy or memory-heavy tasks.
